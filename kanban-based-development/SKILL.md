# Kanban-Based Development

Autonomous, parallel-safe development using `kanban-md` to coordinate work on a shared board.
Claims prevent duplicate work; `review` is the waiting room (handoff, user action, merge, decisions).

## Multi-Agent Environment

**This board is shared.** Multiple agents and humans may be working on it simultaneously. You are NOT the only one reading or modifying tasks. This means:

- Another agent may claim a task between the time you list it and try to pick it.
- Tasks you saw as available a moment ago may no longer be available.

The **claim** mechanic is the coordination primitive. It prevents two agents from working on the same task. **You MUST claim a task before starting any work on it, and you MUST only pick unclaimed tasks.** Violating this causes duplicate work, merge conflicts, and wasted effort.

## Non-Negotiables

- **Claim before you change anything.** No task edits, no code changes.
- **Plan before you build.** For non-trivial tasks, write a plan and STOP for user approval before any code changes or worktree creation. The claim does not authorize implementation — only investigation and planning.
- **Check project conventions first.** Always read the project's `AGENTS.md` (and any nested ones) before starting work. If the project requires plans under `docs/plans/` or has other planning rules, follow them. The kanban claim does not bypass project planning workflow.
- **One active task per agent.** Keep at most one task in `in-progress` for your agent session.
- **Never steal a live claim.** If it's claimed, pick something else.
- **Never release someone else’s claim.** Only use `edit --release` for your own work (or when the user explicitly asks).
- **Always leave a handoff.** Before you park a task, write a short update in the body so someone else can continue.
- **Refresh claims to avoid timeout.** If the task might take longer than `claim_timeout`, periodically renew your claim: `kanban-md edit <ID> --claim <agent>`.
- **Review verdict ends your session scope.** After spawning the review sub-agent and appending its block, your work on this task is done for this session — regardless of verdict. APPROVE does not authorize you to proceed to merge unilaterally; it means the task is ready and the user may direct a merge. CHANGES_REQUESTED means hand off immediately. In both cases: stop, pick the next task (or report there is nothing to pick), and wait.

## Trivial Task

Several rules below relax for trivial tasks. A task is **trivial** only if it
is one of:

- a typo fix
- a single-line code change
- a comment- or doc-only edit
- a board-only change

Touching more than one file of tracked code, changing a function signature,
API, or schema, or modifying tests as the primary change is **not** trivial.
If unsure, it is not trivial.

## Board Home vs Worktrees (simple rule)

- **Always run `kanban-md` from board home** (the canonical repo directory that owns the shared board).
- **Always do code changes in a task worktree.** Never edit code in board home.
- If the board is git-tracked, **commit board changes on `main` as a separate commit** after the task is merged and moved to `done`.

At the start of the session, determine and remember `<board-home>`:

```bash
cd <the canonical repo directory that owns the shared board>
pwd   # remember this path as <board-home>
```

Recommended: keep two shells (or split panes) open:

- **Board shell** at `<board-home>` for `kanban-md` commands
- **Worktree shell** at the task worktree for code changes

Do not run multiple mutating `kanban-md` commands in parallel against the same board directory.

If you are unsure you’re using the shared board, run `kanban-md board --compact` and confirm the board name/shape is what you expect.

## Defer-to-User Boundary

By default, agents should:

1. Claim → investigate → write plan → **PAUSE for user approval**
2. After approval: worktree → implement → merge → done

Defer to the user (leave the task in `review` with a handoff) when you need:

- **plan approval** before implementing anything non-trivial (default for any task touching tracked code)
- **merge to main** — always requires explicit user direction; an APPROVE review verdict does not authorize autonomous merge
- an important product/spec decision with multiple valid options and no clear winner
- credentials/access or external actions (push to remote, releases, deployments, ENV variables, etc.)
- a merge conflict that requires judgment (not just mechanical resolution)
- repeated test/lint failures you can’t resolve

## Agent Identity (for claims)

Each agent session must generate a unique name to identify itself for claims. At the very start of a session, run:

```bash
kanban-md agent-name
```

This produces a name like `quiet-storm` or `frost-maple`. **Remember this name in your context** and use it as a literal string in all claim/release commands for the rest of the session. Do not store it in a file or environment variable — those are not persistent or isolated between agents.

Example: if the generated name is `frost-maple`, use `--claim frost-maple` in every claim command.

## Default Loop (worktree → merge → done)

Use `--compact` for board/list/log output whenever available to keep output short.

Before picking work, ensure board home is on `main`:

```bash
cd <board-home>
git switch main
git status
```

### 1) Pick and claim (atomically)

From board home:

Pick only from startable columns to avoid accidentally re-picking `review` work:

```bash
kanban-md pick --claim <agent> --status todo --move in-progress
```

If `todo` is empty:

```bash
kanban-md pick --claim <agent> --status backlog --move in-progress
```

This is atomic — if another agent claims the task between your list and claim, `pick` handles it safely. No need to list/choose/claim manually.

After picking, read the full task:

```bash
kanban-md show <ID>
```

### 1.5) Write a plan and pause

For any task that touches tracked code/config (i.e. anything that needs a worktree):

1. Write the plan to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-description>.md` (or wherever the project's `AGENTS.md` specifies)
2. Plan must include: **goal**, **proposed changes** (with file paths), and **open questions**
3. **Link the plan from the task** (required — this is how reviewers and other agents find the plan):
   ```bash
   kanban-md edit <ID> --append-body "Plan: [docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md](docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md) — awaiting approval." --timestamp --claim <agent>
   ```
4. **STOP and wait for the user** to review/approve and answer open questions before creating a worktree or writing code.

Skip this step only for trivial tasks (see "Trivial Task" definition above) — and call out explicitly that you're skipping it and why.

### 2) Create a worktree (default)

Before creating a worktree, confirm:

- [ ] Plan file exists (or task is genuinely trivial)
- [ ] Plan is linked from the task body
- [ ] User has explicitly approved (e.g. "proceed", "go ahead", "implement")
- [ ] Open questions in the plan are answered

**Load the `using-git-worktrees` skill first** — it handles the project's worktree-root convention and branch fuzzy-matching. If that skill is not available, fall back to:

```bash
git worktree add ../kanban-md-task-<ID> -b task/<ID>-<kebab-description>
cd ../kanban-md-task-<ID>
```

Skip a worktree only for truly non-conflicting work (e.g., board-only changes or writing an untracked research report). If you touch tracked code/config, use a worktree.

### 3) Implement, test, commit (in the worktree)

Implement the smallest change that satisfies the task.

- Bugs: write a failing test first (TDD), then fix.
- Run the appropriate checks for the change (common defaults):
  - `go test ./...`
  - `golangci-lint run ./...`

Commit in the worktree when green:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: <description>"
```

### Progress notes (recommended)

While a task is `in-progress`, leave short timestamped notes in the task body from **board home** (especially after major steps or before/after running tests). This makes handoffs and reviews much faster.

```bash
kanban-md edit <ID> --append-body "Implemented X/Y/Z, now running tests." --timestamp --claim <agent>
```

The `--append-body` (`-a`) flag appends text to the existing body without replacing it. The `--timestamp` (`-t`) flag prefixes a timestamp line like `[[2026-02-10]] Mon 15:04`.

### 3.5) Self-review (sub-agent)

Before merging, run an independent self-review of the changes. The kanban
workflow owns the orchestration here; the actual review checklist lives in
the `reviewing-changes` skill, which the sub-agent loads.

**Skip review entirely if the task is trivial** (see "Trivial Task"
definition near the top). When skipping, append a one-line note to the task
body for auditability:

```bash
kanban-md edit <ID> --append-body "Skipped review (trivial: <reason>)" --timestamp --claim <agent>
```

Then pick the next task.

For non-trivial tasks:

- Keep the task in `in-progress` during review. It flips to `review`
  with a block immediately on `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (see below).
- **Spawn a fresh-context sub-agent** to perform the review. In OpenCode,
  use the `task` tool with `subagent_type: general`. In Claude Code, use
  the equivalent `Task` tool with a general-purpose subagent. The
  fresh-context sub-agent is what gives the review independence — loading
  `reviewing-changes` in your own context will not.
- The sub-agent runs **from the worktree shell** (cwd = the task worktree
  path), so `git diff main...HEAD` and file reads resolve against the
  branch under review.

Sub-agent prompt template (pass as the `prompt` argument; fill in the
placeholders):

```
Load the `reviewing-changes` skill (via the `skill` tool) and follow its
instructions.

Inputs:
- Task ID: <ID>
- Plan: <path read from the task body>
- Base ref: main
- Head ref / branch: task/<ID>-<slug>
- Worktree path: <absolute path; this is your cwd>

Return only the markdown review block (no commentary before or after).
```

When the sub-agent returns, append the entire returned block to the task
body from board home:

```bash
cd <board-home>
kanban-md edit <ID> --append-body "<review block>" --timestamp --claim <agent>
```

Branch on the verdict (the token after `verdict:` on the first line):

- **APPROVE** → append the review block, then hand the task to the user:

  ```bash
  kanban-md handoff <ID> --claim <agent> \
    --note "Review APPROVED. Ready to merge: task/<ID>-<slug>" \
    --timestamp --release
  ```

  Then pick the next task. The user will direct merge when ready (e.g. "merge task 8", "proceed to merge").

- **CHANGES_REQUESTED** → **do not attempt to fix.** Immediately follow
  the [Blocked / Needs User Input](#blocked--needs-user-input-the-review-and-move-on-rule)
  procedure. The findings are already appended to the task body, so the
  handoff note can be a one-liner pointing at the latest review block:

  ```bash
  kanban-md handoff <ID> --claim <agent> \
    --block "Review found N blocking issue(s)" \
    --note "See latest review block in task body." \
    --timestamp --release
  ```

  Then pick the next task. When the user resolves the findings (themselves
  or by directing an agent), the task is re-claimed via the existing
  "Resuming a parked task" procedure and a fresh review is run as part of
  resuming work.

  **Scope rule for the resuming agent**: when a task is resumed after a
  review block, your scope is **the blocking findings in the latest review
  block**, not the original task description. The original implementation
  is assumed correct except where the review identified blockers. Do not
  refactor unrelated code, re-do completed work, or expand scope. After
  addressing the blockers, run §3.5 again (fresh sub-agent) — the
  reviewer does re-read the full diff, so any drift will surface. If you
  believe the review missed something or a finding is wrong, leave a note
  on the task and defer to the user; do not silently override.

> *Future extension point: an autonomous-fix mode would branch here to
> attempt fixing blocking findings before handing off. Not implemented —
> for now all `CHANGES_REQUESTED` verdicts go straight to handoff.*

Each review (initial or post-resume) must be a fresh sub-agent invocation
(new context). It re-reads the plan and the full diff via the skill — do
not try to "continue" a previous review.

## Resuming for merge (user-directed)

The steps below are **not** an automatic continuation of implementation. They run only when the user explicitly directs a merge (e.g. "merge task 8", "go ahead and merge", "proceed to merge"). At that point, re-claim the task, move it back to `in-progress`, and follow the steps below.

### 4) Merge to main (from board home)

Before merging, confirm:

- [ ] Working tree is clean in the worktree and tests pass
- [ ] Latest review verdict on the task is `APPROVE` (or task is trivial)

Switch back to board home and merge your task branch:

```bash
cd <board-home>
git switch main
git status
```

If `git status` shows unexpected changes outside the board directory (usually `kanban/`) or a git operation in progress, do not proceed. Park the task in `review` and move on.

Merge and re-run tests on main:

```bash
git merge task/<ID>-<kebab-description>
go test ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
```

If you cannot merge right now (e.g., another merge/rebase is in progress), do **not** force. Park the task in `review`, leave a note (branch name + what’s left), and pick the next task.

To park a “ready to merge” task:

From board home:

```bash
kanban-md handoff <ID> --claim <agent> --note "Ready to merge: task/<ID>-…; remaining: …" --timestamp --release
```

### 5) Mark done (only after merge)

Only after the merge is on main and checks pass:

From board home:

```bash
kanban-md edit <ID> --release
kanban-md move <ID> done
```

### 6) Commit board changes (only if board is git-tracked)

From board home:

```bash
git add kanban/config.yml kanban/tasks/
git commit -m "chore(board): update task #<ID>"
```

### 7) Optional cleanup

```bash
git worktree remove --force ../kanban-md-task-<ID>
git branch -d task/<ID>-<kebab-description>
```

## Blocked / Needs User Input (the “review and move on” rule)

If you cannot continue without the user (decision, access, environment, or anything outside your control):

From board home:

```bash
kanban-md handoff <ID> --claim <agent> \
  --block "Waiting on user: <what you need>" \
  --note "## Handoff
- Current state:
- Branch (if any):
- Open questions (A/B):
- Next step:" \
  --timestamp --release
```

In your handoff note, include:

- The exact question(s) for the user (prefer A/B options)
- What you already tried and what happened
- The minimal next step after the user responds

Then pick the next task. Do not idle.

## Resuming a parked task

When the user answers and you need to continue, re-claim and move back to `in-progress`:

From board home:

```bash
kanban-md edit <ID> --claim <agent>
kanban-md edit <ID> --unblock --claim <agent>   # if it was blocked
kanban-md move <ID> in-progress --claim <agent>
```

If the task was parked on a review block, your scope is constrained to
the blocking findings in the latest review block — see the scope rule in
§3.5. Do not re-do the original task.

## Status meanings (keep the board honest)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `in-progress` | Actively being worked by an agent right now |
| `review` | Waiting state: ready to merge, or waiting on user/decision/unblock |
| `done` | Merged to main (and checks pass) |

## When there is nothing to pick

If `pick` returns "no unblocked, unclaimed tasks found":

- Check blocked work: `kanban-md list --compact --blocked`
- Check waiting work: `kanban-md list --compact --status review`
- If everything is waiting on the user, ask targeted questions and stop (don't thrash the board).
